# WEBFLIX Recommender System Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a hybrid recommender system for WEBFLIX, a platform transitioning from a local DVD store to an online streaming service. The recommender system combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to provide personalized movie recommendations to users.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the MovieLens Latest Small dataset, which includes movie ratings, movie metadata (genres, tags), and user information.

## System Components

1. **Collaborative Filtering**: Predicts user's ratings for movies based on the ratings of similar users.
2. **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies similar to those a user has liked in the past, using movie metadata.
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Integrates collaborative and content-based filtering to improve recommendation quality and personalization.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Data Preparation

-   Load the `movies.csv`, `ratings.csv`, `tags.csv`, and `links.csv` files.
-   Preprocess data to handle missing values, if any.

### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-   Analyze the distribution of ratings, movies, and user interactions.
-   Identify the most common genres and tags.

### Step 3: Collaborative Filtering Component

-   Implement a model-based collaborative filtering using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method.
-   Use cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance.

### Step 4: Content-Based Component

-   Calculate similarities between movies based on genres and tags.
-   Develop a system to recommend movies based on these similarities.

### Step 5: Hybrid Model Integration

-   Combine the scores from collaborative filtering and content-based components.
-   Explore different integration strategies, such as weighted average or machine learning models.

### Step 6: Evaluation and Feedback Loop

-   Evaluate the recommender system using metrics like RMSE, precision, and recall.
-   Integrate user feedback to continuously improve the recommendation quality.

## Dependencies

-   Pandas for data manipulation.
-   Surprise library for collaborative filtering.
-   Scikit-learn for content similarity calculations and machine learning models.

## Further Steps

-   Explore advanced machine learning models for hybrid recommendation.
-   Implement a user interface for interacting with the recommender system.
-   Continuously monitor and update the system based on user interactions and feedback.
